# Editing .tscn and .tres

You may edit any scene or resource as text, visual properties included. Godot 4.7 normalises the file the next time the editor saves it, so keep edits minimal and in Godot's own shape.

Finish every edit with `uv run tools/check.py load`. It loads every scene and fails on parse errors and missing dependencies. After a visual change, also run `uv run tools/check.py capture <scene>` and look at the frame it names.

## File shape

Sections come in this order: header, `ext_resource`s, `sub_resource`s, nodes, connections.

```
[gd_scene format=3 uid="uid://cmx3l2s0kq7ab"]

[ext_resource type="Script" uid="uid://f5jcsgy0san3" path="res://ui/main_menu/main_menu.gd" id="1_menu"]
[ext_resource type="PackedScene" uid="uid://b8w4hd0vq1n2c" path="res://ui/settings/settings_menu.tscn" id="2_sett"]

[sub_resource type="LabelSettings" id="LabelSettings_title"]
font_size = 32

[node name="MainMenu" type="Control" unique_id=1296613593]
layout_mode = 3
anchors_preset = 15
anchor_right = 1.0
anchor_bottom = 1.0
grow_horizontal = 2
grow_vertical = 2
script = ExtResource("1_menu")

[node name="Buttons" type="VBoxContainer" parent="."]
layout_mode = 2

[node name="PlayButton" type="Button" parent="Buttons"]
unique_name_in_owner = true
layout_mode = 2
text = "Play"

[node name="SettingsMenu" parent="." instance=ExtResource("2_sett")]
visible = false

[connection signal="pressed" from="Buttons/PlayButton" to="." method="_on_play_button_pressed"]
```

- **Header:** `[gd_scene format=3]`, plus `uid="..."` when the file already has one. Leave out `load_steps`; 4.7 doesn't write it.
- **`parent`:** the root node has none. Its children use `parent="."`, deeper nodes the path from the root (`parent="Buttons"`, `parent="Buttons/Row"`). A node's block comes after its parent's.
- **`id`:** any string unique within the file. Godot writes `1_abcde` for ext_resources and `Type_abcde` for sub_resources; a readable suffix (`1_menu`) works too.
- **Properties:** only values that differ from the default are written. Leave a default out instead of writing it.
- **Sub-scene:** a node with `instance=ExtResource(...)` and no `type`. Its own nodes stay in its own file.
- **Unique names:** `unique_name_in_owner = true` on a node lets its scene's script write `%PlayButton`.

## unique_id

Godot 4.7 writes `unique_id=<number>` on every node it saves. Leave it out of every node you write: Godot assigns one on the next save. When you copy or duplicate a node block, delete its `unique_id=` so two nodes never share one. Keep the ones already in the file unchanged.

## References

The `uid://` is authoritative and the `path` is the fallback: a valid uid finds the file even after a move, and an unknown uid falls back to the path with an `invalid UID` warning. Copy the uid from where Godot stores it rather than inventing one:

| Target | Where its uid is |
|---|---|
| Script or shader (`.gd`, `.gdshader`) | The `<file>.uid` sidecar next to it |
| Imported asset (`.png`, `.glb`, `.ogg`, …) | `uid=` under `[remap]` in `<file>.import` |
| Scene or resource (`.tscn`, `.tres`) | `uid=` in its header line |

If the target has no uid yet (a scene saved without one, or a script before its first import), write `path` alone. `check.py` imports the project first, which creates the missing sidecars; commit them.

## UI scenes

Build UI from Containers styled by the shared Theme in `ui/`:

- The root Control fills the screen with the full-rect block shown above (`layout_mode = 3`, `anchors_preset = 15`, anchors 1.0, grow 2) and carries `theme = ExtResource(...)`.
- A child of a Container gets `layout_mode = 2` and no anchors or offsets: the Container places it.
- Spacing comes from `MarginContainer` and the Theme's separations, never from per-node offsets.

## Generating many nodes

For bulk generation (dozens of nodes, a grid of tiles), write a `-s` SceneTree script that builds the nodes, sets each one's `owner` to the root, and saves with `PackedScene.pack()` + `ResourceSaver.save()`. This rewrites every `id` and adds `unique_id`s, so the diff touches the whole file. Use text edits for everything smaller.

## Merge conflicts

Take one side whole: `git checkout --ours <file>` or `git checkout --theirs <file>`. Redo the other side's change by hand as a fresh edit, then run `uv run tools/check.py load`.
