# Design

What the game is. Read this before gameplay work and update it when the design changes. On jam day the content under each heading is replaced by the real game; the headings stay.

Right now it describes the **example game scene**: the small scene that shows the patterns to copy.

## Pitch

A cosy 3D toy: click the ground to place cubes on it. It shows the soft look and the patterns for input, the signal bus, audio and settings working together.

## Core loop

1. The player points at the ground plane.
2. A click places a cube where the pointer meets the ground.
3. The game reacts: the placement SFX plays, the camera gives a small shake, and the HUD count goes up.

There is no goal and no failure state.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left click on the ground | Place a cube |
| Esc | Open or close the pause menu |

Mouse only, apart from Esc. Open question: whether right-drag orbits the camera.

## Scenes and flow

```
main menu ──Play──▶ game ──Esc──▶ pause menu ──Main menu──▶ main menu
    │                                  │
    └──Settings──▶ settings panel ◀──Settings
```

- **Main menu** (`ui/main_menu/`): the main scene. Title, Play, Settings, Quit (Quit hidden on web). On web, a "click anywhere to start" overlay comes first, and that click starts the menu music.
- **Game** (`game/`): camera, lighting, the soft-look environment, a ground plane, and the HUD placed-count label. Placing a cube emits `Events.piece_placed`, and the HUD listens. The camera shake is skipped when `Settings.reduce_motion` is on. It instances the pause menu.
- **Pause menu** (`ui/pause_menu/`): Resume, Settings, Main menu. Pauses the tree; music keeps playing.
- **Settings panel** (`ui/settings/`): Master, Music and SFX volume, and Reduce motion. Shared by the main menu and the pause menu.

Scene changes go through `SceneFlow.go_to`, which fades to black and back.

## Scope

- **In:** the scenes above, ambient menu music, UI and placement SFX, settings saved across sessions.
- **Out:** levels, goals, scoring, saving progress, dialogue, positional or adaptive audio. These depend on the game idea and are built during the jam.
